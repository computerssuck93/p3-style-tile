/* This is just a basic microsoft font, pretty much identical to about 60 other
fonts however there are just enough subtle differences to make me like this one. 
I couldn't find any google fonts, well identical to it, so i just decided to embed 
the actual font. It says editable in the font properties, so if there is some licensing
issue or any problem really, since it is a  "Microsoft" font... well...
ZERO FUCKS GIVEN 

So i decided instead to go with my favorite font :) Bleeding Cowboys. I didn't even really
think about using that font until i was nearly finished. Nonetheless, it's my favorite font
and if i had the money i would actually by the rights to the font, just so i could say it's mine.
